Loads or saves the Fantasya game world to a storage medium (database, xml, or whatever makes sense).

<p>
Since the serialization is heavily biased towards databases, we always store
everything in a database way (in tables), although some formats (xml) provide much
more suitable hierarchical data layouts. As such, in the following, we will
always talk of tables, columns and rows, although the serialization code is not
restricted to databases. Loading of objects goes in three layers:
</p>

<p>
On the innermost level, there are primitive ("basic") serializers ({@see
de.x8bit.Fantasya.Host.serialization.basic.ObjectSerializer}). Given a mapping
of key-value pairs (i.e., essentially a single row of a table), they can
construct a new object (e.g., a UnitSerializer creates a new unit) or
modify an existing object (e.g., a SkillSerializer "teaches" an existing
unit). In the other direction, given a corresponding object, these basic
serializers return a small table that gives the serialized form of the
appropriate property (unit, unit skills, party alliances etc.). The mini table
is returned in the form of a 
{@ref de.x8bit.Fantasya.Host.serialization.util.SerializedData} object, which is
essentially a list of key-value maps (strings only) that can be merged etc.
</p>

<p>
One level up, there are always repeating procedures what to do after an object
is loaded, or which objects to save. For example, a repeating pattern is that a
whole database table has to be converted into many units, which are put in a
list/cache on loading, and on saving each element in the list must be saved.
These patterns are implemented by 
{@ref de.x8bit.Fantasya.Host.serialization.complex.ComplexHandler}
implementations. They usually get a basic serializer to do the actual
line-by-line loading and object-by-object saving. The input on loading and the
output on saving is a SerializedData object that contains the combined data
describing, e.g., all elements in the list.
</p>

<p>
In a final step, we need to convert our custom SerializedData object
from or to the storage (the database or an XML file). This is done by
so-called adapters. Adapters basically take a table name and a SerializedData
object, and convert this from or into the appropriate storage format.
</p>

<p>
The whole code is then thrown together in the
{@link de.x8bit.Fantasya.Host.EVA.serialization.Serializer} class. This class in
turn is set up with the default order of the tables etc. by the
{@link de.x8bit.Fantasya.Host.EVA.serialization.SerializerFactory} class.
