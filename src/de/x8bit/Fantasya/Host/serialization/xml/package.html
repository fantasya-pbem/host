The adapter and various helper files to make Serialization work with Xml files.

<p>
The basic idea is that there is a Database consisting of Tables consisting of
Rows, which in turn consist of Entries. The Database is loaded automagically
via Jaxb and filled with corresponding "table" data from the xml file. An
adapter then takes care for the remaining transformation into a SerializedData
object and back.
